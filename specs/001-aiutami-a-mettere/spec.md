# Feature Specification: Aiutami a mettere in produzione su Railway

**Feature Branch**: `001-aiutami-a-mettere`
**Created**: September 15, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "aiutami a mettere in produzione su railway"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer of the AI Cash Revolution platform, I want to deploy my trading application to production on Railway so that users can access the live trading signals and mobile application in a stable, scalable environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the AI Cash Revolution code is ready for deployment, **When** I initiate the Railway deployment process, **Then** the application should be successfully deployed and accessible to end-users within 24 hours.
2. **Given** the Railway environment is configured, **When** users access the mobile app or web interface, **Then** the trading signals should generate within 30 seconds and execute trades through the MT5 bridge.
3. **Given** the production deployment is active, **When** the system reaches peak usage periods, **Then** it should handle 10,000+ concurrent users without performance degradation.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Railway environment variables are missing or incorrect?
- How does the system handle database connection failures during deployment?
- What happens when MT5 credentials are not properly configured in production?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a complete Railway deployment configuration that includes all necessary environment variables and database connections
- **FR-002**: System MUST deploy successfully to Railway infrastructure with all trading workflow modules functional
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to access the live AI cash trading platform through the deployed Railway environment
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain trading signal generation performance of less than 30 seconds in the cloud environment
- **FR-005**: System MUST support secure user authentication through the Railway deployment [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Deploy the existing Google OAuth integration or simplify for Railway?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain data persistence through Railway-compatible database connections
- **FR-007**: System MUST support MT5 bridge functionality for trade execution in the production environment [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: MT5 demo credentials or production credentials handling?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide monitoring and logging capabilities through Railway infrastructure
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle production-level traffic with appropriate scaling configurations
