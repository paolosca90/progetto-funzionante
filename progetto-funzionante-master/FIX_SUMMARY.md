# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Railway deployment was failing with the error:
```
pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation error for SecuritySettings jwt_secret_key Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]
```

## Root Cause
The JWT_SECRET_KEY environment variable was missing from the Railway configuration, causing the pydantic validation to fail during application startup.

## Files Modified

### 1. `railway.json`
- **Issue**: Environment variables were referenced with `$VAR` syntax instead of Railway's `${{VAR}}` syntax
- **Fix**: Updated to use proper Railway variable referencing syntax
- **Changes**:
  - Changed `$JWT_SECRET_KEY` to `${{JWT_SECRET_KEY}}`
  - Added build-time environment check
  - Organized variables into logical groups
  - Added missing variables like `EMAIL_FROM`

### 2. `validate_env.py` (Created)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive environment variable validation script
- **Features**:
  - Validates all required environment variables
  - Checks for proper formats (JWT key length, database URL, etc.)
  - Provides clear error messages and templates
  - Works locally and in Railway environment

### 3. `railway_check.py` (Created)
- **Purpose**: Build-time environment validation for Railway
- **Features**:
  - Checks all required variables before deployment
  - Validates critical settings during build process
  - Prevents deployment if required variables are missing

### 4. `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` (Created)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive deployment guide
- **Contents**:
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Required environment variables with examples
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Production considerations

## Required Environment Variables

### Security
- **JWT_SECRET_KEY**: Must be at least 32 characters long
- **SECRET_KEY**: Application secret key

### Database
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (provided by Railway)

### OANDA API
- **OANDA_API_KEY**: Your OANDA API token
- **OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID**: Your OANDA account ID
- **OANDA_ENVIRONMENT**: "demo" or "live"

### AI Integration
- **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Google Gemini API key

### Email
- **EMAIL_HOST**: SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
- **EMAIL_USER**: Email address for sending
- **EMAIL_PASSWORD**: Email password/app password
- **EMAIL_FROM**: Sender email address

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Update Railway Variables
Navigate to Railway dashboard â†’ Variables tab and add:

```bash
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-here-min-32-chars
OANDA_API_KEY=your-oanda-api-token
OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID=your-oanda-account-id
OANDA_ENVIRONMENT=demo
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

### 2. Add Railway Services
- Add PostgreSQL service (automatically provides DATABASE_URL)
- Optionally add Redis service for caching

### 3. Deploy
- Railway will now validate environment variables during build
- Application will start successfully with all required variables

## Validation Tools

### Local Validation
```bash
python validate_env.py
```

### Railway Build Validation
- Automatically runs during build process
- Prevents deployment if critical variables are missing

## Testing

After deployment, test:
1. Health check: `GET /health`
2. API endpoint: `GET /api/signals/latest`
3. Web interface access

## Additional Improvements

1. **Build-time validation**: Added environment checks to fail fast
2. **Better error messages**: Clear guidance on missing variables
3. **Comprehensive documentation**: Step-by-step deployment guide
4. **Proper variable referencing**: Uses Railway's variable syntax
5. **Security validation**: Ensures JWT key meets requirements

## Result

The application should now:
- Pass build-time environment validation
- Start successfully on Railway
- Have all required API keys and configurations
- Provide clear error messages if variables are missing

## Next Steps

1. Apply these changes to your Railway project
2. Configure all required environment variables
3. Add PostgreSQL and optionally Redis services
4. Deploy and test the application
5. Run the validation script to confirm configuration
